# LUCIA: Chat-Based Todo App with Dynamic Data Interaction

**LUCIA** is a chat-based todo application that allows users to manage tasks seamlessly while leveraging real-time communication and dynamic data handling. Built with modern protocols and designed for both ease of use and flexibility, LUCIA provides more than just task management—she integrates a dynamic interaction with backend services, making her a powerful tool for developers and users alike.

## Key Features:
- **Chat-Based Todos**: Manage your tasks directly from chat, with easy-to-use commands.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Uses secure WebSocket and gRPC protocols to keep everything in sync with the backend.
- **Dynamic Data Handling**: LUCIA interacts with the backend dynamically, similar to Firebase or Supabase, without the need for heavy lifting on the frontend.
- **Custom UI Integration**: Supports Kanban, project lists, notes, and more via a customizable interface.

## Why LUCIA?
LUCIA is built for simplicity on the frontend but is highly powerful under the hood. Unlike traditional task management systems, LUCIA takes advantage of advanced technologies to handle backend communication and dynamic queries without overwhelming developers with too many parameters or boilerplate code.

### The Four Key Projects Behind LUCIA:
LUCIA doesn’t work alone. She is supported by four other open-source projects, each one offering a crucial part of the ecosystem:

1. **Elara**: An API-based database service that enables dynamic querying of database data. Elara integrates seamlessly with LUCIA to provide flexible data retrieval and manipulation.
2. **Serena**: A JavaScript API client designed to simplify backend calls. Serena ensures smooth communication between LUCIA and the backend, making the developer’s job easier.
3. **Celeste**: A robust service ensuring fast and reliable communication between Elara and Serena. Celeste uses modern protocols like WebSocket and gRPC to maintain secure, high-speed data transfers.
4. **Corina**: A presentation layer that allows developers to easily handle CRUD operations through a customizable interface. Corina is used by LUCIA to provide a dynamic UI experience for todos, projects, notes, and more.

These dream projects will push the boundaries of what LUCIA and her sisters can do, evolving into a powerful ecosystem for building dynamic, data-driven applications.

## Get Involved
I welcome contributions and feedback from the community. You can help build out LUCIA’s features, refine her sisters' capabilities, or even contribute to the dream projects as they come to life. Together, we can make this vision a reality.

## Note: Elara, Serena, Celeste, and Corina Dream Projects
Elara, Serena, Celeste, and Corina have their upgrade version system that yet unmaintaned yet. but if you want to know them, here i give you the list

- **Throne**: A more advanced version of Elara, Throne is designed to be an omni-platform and language-agnostic API-based database service that uses graph-based querying for dynamic data. 
- **Seraph**: The future version of Serena, Seraph will be an omni-platform API client, built on Dart and adaptable to multiple languages.
- **qRPC-Socket**: A revolutionary approach to API communication, combining WebSocket handshakes, gRPC binary converters, and RPC calls for ultra-efficient data handling.
- **Obelisk**: A dynamic data-driven CRM that automates UI and database schema exchanges, making it possible to create systems like Notion, but fully integrated with backend logic.
